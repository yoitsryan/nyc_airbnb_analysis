# nyc_airbnb_analysis
My final project for Applied Machine Learning class at Colgate University (Spring 2021).

There was a lot of code used in this project. To be efficient and avoid long load times and lots of scrolling, I spread the code across 4 Jupyter notebook files.

Notebook 1 starts with the basics: My Airbnb dataset, and various regression techniques.
Notebook 2 incorporates data from Niche.com, a self-compiled supplement to the Airbnb data.
Notebook 3 has reusable blocks of code, because more data will be filtered out.
Notebook 4 has code used for generating and saving some plots.
